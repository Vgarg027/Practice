    "This analysis looks into the relations that genre, release year, and budget (adjusted for inflation) have with a movies' overall rating and profit based on the data from The Movie Database (TMDb), which includes information, classifications, and statistics about nearly 11,000 movies.\n",
    "### Dataset Description \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question(s) for Analysis\n",
    "The questions to be answered are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-What is the most highly rated movie genre in each year?\n",
    "2-Which movie genre is the most profitable on average by year?\n",
    "3-How much did the average budget of the genres' movies appear to influence the ratings of the movies?\n",
    "Please note that the explanations for the executed code will precede the code itself throughout the report.\n",

    "\n",
    "What is the most highly rated movie genre in each year?\n",
    "Which movie genre is the most profitable on average by year?\n",
    "How much did the average budget of the genres' movies appear to influence the ratings of the movies?\n",
    "The most highly rated movie genre by year varied, but the Documentary genre was the genre that had the highest average rating across the most years. This may be because documentaries are more serious productions that tend to be polished and because less of them are produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most profitible movie genre by year varied as well, but the Adventure genre was the genre that had the highest average profit across the most years. This may be because this genre also tended to have the highest budget, but also because it is one of the more popular movie genres that have a wider audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a higher average budget does appear to have a very slight association with a higher average vote rating, but more statistical analysis will need to be performed to prove anything. Additionally, the highest and lowest vote ratings of all the dataset were with lower budget movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information it can be determined that in order to make a more successful movie measured by voted ratings, one should make a documentary with the highest budget possible, and that to make a more successful movie by profit or revenue, one should make adventure movies with higher budgets when able.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further analysis would be beneficial by factoring the vote_count values into the calculations to eliminate bias or statistical outliers in movies with very high or very low vote_average values but low vote_count values. Additionally, this analysis is limited because of how the averages of each year and overall were divided and compared by individual genre. Doing the same for genre pairs would give more insightful information into the nuances of genre popularity and success.\n",
