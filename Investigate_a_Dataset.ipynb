    "This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.\n",
    "● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.\n",
    "● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.\n",
    "● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.\n",
    "● ‘No_show’ it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "• As we can see sending an SMS for the appiontment is not neccessary the right option to make sure that the patient will come\n",
    "\n",
    "• As we can see in our investigation the Age is the most important factor that decided if a patient would come or not the average of age for people who will be most likely to show up is 39.07518726482 , and the average age for people who are not likely to show up is 35.329151291512915.\n",
    "\n",
    "• As we can see about 22.8% of people that schedule an appointment did not make it to thier appointment\n",
    "\n",
    "• As we can see most of people who has Scholarship are most likely to miss thier appointments with a percentage of 76.2% of showing and patients who don't have a scholarship have the percentage 80.1%\n",
    "\n",
    "• the features such as different gender or alcoholic is not a factor to decide if the person would come to his appointment or not!\n",
