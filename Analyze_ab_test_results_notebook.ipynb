    "### About the two-sample z-test\n",
    "Recall that you have plotted a distribution `p_diffs` representing the\n",
    "difference in the \"converted\" probability  $(p{'}_{new}-p{'}_{old})$  for your two simulated samples 10,000 times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way for comparing the mean of two independent and normal distribution is a **two-sample z-test**. You can perform the Z-test to calculate the Z_score, as shown in the equation below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z_{score} = \\frac{ (p{'}_{new}-p{'}_{old}) - (p_{new}  -  p_{old})}{ \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{new} }{n_{new}} + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{old} }{n_{old}}  } }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where,\n",
    "- $p{'}$ is the \"converted\" success rate in the sample\n",
    "- $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ are the \"converted\" success rate for the two groups in the population. \n",
    "- $\\sigma_{new}$ and $\\sigma_{new}$ are the standard deviation for the two groups in the population. \n",
    "- $n_{new}$ and $n_{old}$ represent the size of the two groups or samples (it's same in our case)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">Z-test is performed when the sample size is large, and the population variance is known. The z-score represents the distance between the two \"converted\" success rates in terms of the standard error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is to make a decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on comparing these two values: \n",
    "- $Z_{score}$\n",
    "- $Z_{\\alpha}$ or $Z_{0.05}$, also known as critical value at 95% confidence interval.  $Z_{0.05}$ is 1.645 for one-tailed tests,  and 1.960 for two-tailed test. You can determine the $Z_{\\alpha}$ from the z-table manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decide if your hypothesis is either a two-tailed, left-tailed, or right-tailed test. Accordingly, reject OR fail to reject the  null based on the comparison between $Z_{score}$ and $Z_{\\alpha}$. \n",
    ">Hint:<br>\n",
    "For a right-tailed test, reject null if $Z_{score}$ > $Z_{\\alpha}$. <br>\n",
    "For a left-tailed test, reject null if $Z_{score}$ < $Z_{\\alpha}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we determine whether or not the $Z_{score}$ lies in the \"rejection region\" in the distribution. A \"rejection region\" is an interval where the null hypothesis is rejected iff the $Z_{score}$ lies in that region.\n",

Accordingly, the p_value of four factors are all higher than Type I error rate (0.05), so that, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and the old landing page is recommended to keep, rather than launching the new one\n",
