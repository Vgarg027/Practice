    "Introduction\n",
    "The subject of this analysis is a Kaggle dataset Medical Appointment No Shows which describes more than 110,000 medical appointments in health units located within the city of Vitoria, Brazil and 14 features of each appointment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all the data were clearly explained by the author in Data Dictionary, however some clarifications provided in the Discussion section allowed to conclude the following about features:\n",
    "\n",
    "PatientId - identification of a patient.\n",
    "AppointmentID - identification of each appointment.\n",
    "Gender - gender of a patient: male or female.\n",
    "ScheduledDay - a date on which an appointment was scheduled.\n",
    "AppointmentDay - a date of an appointment.\n",
    "Age - age of a patient.\n",
    "Neighbourhood - a neighbourhood where an appointment took place.\n",
    "Scholarship - if a patient has government financial aid Bolsa Familia: yes or no.\n",
    "Hipertension - if a patient has high blood pressure: yes or no.\n",
    "Diabetes - if a patient has diabetes: yes or now.\n",
    "Alcoholism - if a patient is suffering from alcoholism: yes or now.\n",
    "Handcap - if a patient has disability: the number of all of them.\n",
    "SMS_received - if a patient got a text message appointment reminders: yes or no.\n",
    "No-show - if a patient came to an appointment: no for \"came\" and yes for \"didn't come\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, on the basis of these variables, the following questions can be investigated:\n",
    "\n",
    "Are patient no-shows related to a patient's personal features such as age, gender, the mentioned diseases, disabilities or getting government financial aid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do the appointment reminders affect the coming to the appointment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the number of days between the date when the appointment was scheduled and the appointment date related to whether the patient come to the appointment or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there neighbourhoods where the patients are more likely not to miss their appointments?\n"

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "The analysis showed the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "● In terms of age the greatest tendency to miss their appointments is shown by the young patients, the least - the patients aged 65 y.o. and above. The older the patients get, the less likely they miss the appointments, except for children under the age of 15 y.o. Since they usually visit doctors accompanied by their parents the relation between the missing and not missing appointments is equal the same relation for the patients aged 25-54 y.o.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Women and men miss their appointments equally, however female patients are almost twice as many as male. This can be explained by the fact that women more often accompany their children to medical appointments than men.\n",
    "\n",
    "● The most patients do not have the government financial aid Bolsa Familia and those of them who have tend to miss their appointments more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Vast majority of the patients do not suffer from hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism and do not have any disabilities. The patients with hypertension, alcoholism and disabilities have tendency to miss their appointments more often than the parients who do not have these health issues, and the patients with diabetes on the contrary miss their appointments less often than the patients without diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "● As opposed to what was expected the appointments which were preceded by sms reminders were missed noticeably more than the appointments without sms reminders.\n",
    "\n",
    "● The average waiting time for the appointments is about 10 days although about 25% of the patients can visit their doctors on the same day. While the maximum waiting time is 179 days, 75% of the patients are waiting for the appointment not longer than 15 days. The patients who can visit clinics at the day when they scheduled the appointment tend to miss the appointments less often than the patients who have to wait longer. The patients who have to wait more than one week but less than one months miss their appointments more often than other patients. However, after a month of waiting the longer the patients wait the less they tend to miss the appointments.\n",
    "\n",
    "● The neighbourhood where there are the clinics with the largest number of scheduled appointments and not missing appointments is Jardim Camburi. The neighbourhood with the largest number of not missing appointments in percentage terms is Ilha Do Boi."
