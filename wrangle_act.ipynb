    "   \n",
    "   * This project involves loading a pre-gathered data namely the WeRateDogs Twitter archive into my jupyter notebook and            downloading the tweet image predictions data programatically into the same notebook using the request module in Python.        Additonally, the WeRateDogs Twitter archive was querried programatically from Twitter's API  using an access library            called tweepy to get tweet's retweet count and favorite (\"like\") count data that were ommited from the previously gathered      WeRateDogs Twitter archive.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   * After gathering, the data were assessed visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness issues. At the end, at          least eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues were detected and documented.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   * The result of the assessment stage was used to clean the individual datasets and merge them into a master pandas                DataFrame, stored to a comma seperated file for analysis and visualization \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   * The cleaned master dataset was then analyzed and visualized to produce at least three (3) insights and one (1)                  visualization.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   * Finally a 300-600 word written report with brief description of the wrangling efforts is produced, and another 250-word-        minimum written report to communicate the insights and displays the visualization(s) is produced from the wrangled data.     \n",

    "#### From the figure, it is observed that the intensities of both favorite and retweet counts were similar between 2015-11 to 2016-05,  though the number of favorite counts were higher than retweet counts. The favourite count showed a steady increasing trend above the retweet counts from around 2016-09 to  slightly above 2017-07. The majority of the retweet counts however remained between 0 and 20k. "
